Chat GPT is very good at reasoning and explaining mathemtical problems. However, it often will output the wrong answer.
I believe using wolframalpha's API or Symbolabs API will solve this problem and allow users to get a real time interaction with the AI,
as it is still able to explain the process of solving mathemtical problems.
